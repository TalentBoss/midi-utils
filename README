MIDI-utils
==========

This is a set of useful MIDI-translation tools for Linux-based Digital Audio
Workstations. These tools are mainly simplistic hacks but they do come in
handy in some cases. At least in my studio.

note2note
---------

A simple program that translates input MIDI-notes into other MIDI-notes using
a small configuration files. This comes in handy when you want to hook up
your favorite digital drum-set to another application or hardware that does
not map the correct sample/generator to the given drum-pad.

I wrote this mainly for fun to be able to play the "Drummer"-application in
a Commodore 64 MSSIAH-cartridge from my Roland TD-9 drum-set. It works like a
charm, and I now have realized that it comes in handy if I'd like to sequence
using e.g. Rosegarden and with as little configuration as possible be able to
replace my TD-9 module as sound source by using e.g. Hydrogen. These two does
not map notes in the same way.

note2jacktransport
------------------

If you have some generic device that you wish to use as a transport (play,
stop, record, forward, reverse and so on) for controlling other Linux-
applications that understand Jack Transport.

This tool exists since I have an Event EzBus mixer with transport-controls
that does not talk MIDI Machine Control like you would probably assume. It
rather sends a MIDI note for every button... Hence this hack :D.
