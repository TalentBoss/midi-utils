MIDI-utils
==========

This is a set of useful MIDI-translation tools for Linux-based Digital Audio
Workstations. These tools are mainly simplistic hacks but they do come in
handy in some cases. At least in my studio.

A simple program that translates input MIDI-notes into other MIDI-notes or
MIDI CC messages to other MIDI CC messages or even MIDI-notes into Jack
Transport commands using small configuration files.

This comes in handy when you want to hook up your favorite digital drum-set
to another application or hardware that does not map the correct
sample/generator to the given drum-pad.

I wrote this mainly for fun to be able to play the "Drummer"-application in
a Commodore 64 MSSIAH-cartridge from my Roland TD-9 drum-set. It works like a
charm, and I now have realized that it comes in handy if I'd like to sequence
using e.g. Rosegarden and with as little configuration as possible be able to
replace my TD-9 module as sound source by using e.g. Hydrogen. These two does
not map notes in the same way.
